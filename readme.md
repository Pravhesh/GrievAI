# GrievAI: Decentralized AI Agent Network for Transparent Public Grievance Redressal

GrievAI is a civic tech platform that integrates **AI agents**, **Ethereum smart contracts**, **zero-knowledge privacy**, and **DAO governance** to create a **transparent**, **tamper-proof**, and **accountable** public grievance redressal system.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

- **Opaque Processes**: No visibility into complaint status or accountability.
- **Manual Bottlenecks**: Weeks-long delays due to outdated workflows.
- **Retaliation Fear**: Citizens hesitate to report corruption/safety issues.
- **Data Tampering**: No immutable audit trail in centralized systems.

> **Impact**: Millions of unresolved grievances annually in countries like India. GrievAI ensures all complaints are logged, tracked, and acted upon transparently.

## ✅ MVP Core Features

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **AI Grievance Classification** | Uses Hugging Face model to classify text complaints (e.g., "Water", "Power") and detect spam |
| **Ethereum Smart Contract** | `ComplaintRegistry.sol` with `submitComplaint`, `resolveComplaint`, `escalateComplaint` |
| **Front-End UI** | React + TailwindCSS form to submit grievances and show live dashboard |
| **Simulated Privacy** | Frontend displays "Generating ZK Proof..." animation (no real ZK used) |
| **Simulated DAO** | `escalateComplaint()` callable by admin to mimic DAO decisions |
| **Dashboard** | Real-time status display with Etherscan links and SLA countdowns |
| **Deployment** | Goerli testnet, Hardhat, Etherscan, GitHub, minimal tests |

## 💡 Ideal Full-Scale System

| Layer | Features |
|------|----------|
| **AI Agent (Off-Chain)** | NLP (Hugging Face) + image analysis (TensorFlow/Keras) for spam filtering & evidence verification |
| **Smart Contracts (On-Chain)** | Solidity-based contracts using OpenZeppelin's Governor for DAO functionality |
| **Privacy Infrastructure** | Real ZKPs via Circom/snarkjs and user DIDs with Ceramic/IPFS |
| **DAO Governance** | Real local DAOs vote to escalate/reroute unresolved complaints |
| **Oracle Integration** | Chainlink feeds provide real-world data (e.g., water outage) for SLA checks |
| **Evidence Storage** | Decentralized via IPFS |
| **Monitoring Tools** | Tenderly, Mocha/Chai tests, Etherscan for auditability |
| **Security Practices** | Code audits, static analysis, OpenZeppelin libraries |

---

## 📊 Technical Stack

| Layer | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| AI/ML | Python, Hugging Face, TensorFlow, OpenCV |
| Blockchain | Solidity, Hardhat, Chainlink, OpenZeppelin |
| Privacy | Circom, snarkjs, Ceramic, IPFS |
| UI | React, TailwindCSS, ethers.js, MetaMask, Anime.js |

---

## 👥 Team Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Blockchain Engineer** | Write & test smart contracts, Chainlink integration |
| **AI/ML Engineer** | Train NLP & image models, build agent APIs |
| **Full-Stack Developer** | UI implementation, wallet integration, frontend-backend linkage |
| **PM/UX Lead** | UX design, sprint coordination, pitch materials |

---

## 🎯 KPIs

| Metric | Goal |
|--------|------|
| Classification Accuracy | ≥ 90% |
| On-Chain Latency | ≤ 15 seconds |
| SLA Compliance | ≥ 95% auto-routing/escalation |
| DAO Engagement | ≥ 3 successful proposals |

---

## 🔐 Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| High Gas Costs | Migrate to Layer-2 (e.g., Polygon, zkSync) |
| AI Bias | Use diverse training sets, include human-in-the-loop |
| Adoption Resistance | Partner with NGOs, multi-language onboarding |
| Security Flaws | Code reviews + battle-tested libraries (OpenZeppelin) |

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

| Phase | Objective |
|-------|-----------|
| **Pilot** | Launch with district municipalities |
| **Sector Expansion** | Extend to healthcare, education |
| **Mainnet + Token Model** | Utility token for verification bounties |
| **Global Scaling** | White-label platform + new language models |

## 📽️ Demo Strategy (Hackathon MVP)

- Submit a grievance → AI classifies → On-chain log → Dashboard updates
- “Generating ZK Proof…” spinner to simulate privacy
- Admin-only button to simulate DAO escalation
- Live Etherscan link to show blockchain immutability
